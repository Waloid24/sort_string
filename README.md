# Onegin
Hello! This program allows you to sort the text in the forward (lexicographic) order and in reverse.

To do this, you must compile the program
````
g++ Onegin.cpp print_in_file.cpp work_with_qsort.cpp work_with_src_file.cpp
`
and run it
````
./a.out (source_file).txt (destination_file).txt
```
I wish you a pleasant use!
