Again ye come, ye hovering Forms! I find ye,
And, like an old and half-extinct tradition,
And names the Good, whose cheating fortune tore them
And sway me from your misty, shadowy zone!
As early to my clouded sight ye shone!
First Love returns, with Friendship in his train.
From happy hours, and left me to deplore them.
From magic airs that round your march awaken.
Life tracks his devious, labyrinthine chain,
My bosom thrills, with youthful passion shaken,
Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision;
Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetition
Shall I attempt, this once, to seize and bind ye?
Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown?
The dear, familiar phantoms rise again,
Ye crowd more near! Then, be the reign assigned ye,
