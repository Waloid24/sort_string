A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;And the continuance of their parents' rage,Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,From forth the fatal loins of these two foesIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,The which if you with patient ears attend,Two households, both alike in dignity,What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows

Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
